# The MovieZ App



## Run and start the App with the Docker container

Run `docker-compose up --build` in the `Projekt` path. Docker will build the images for the frontend, backend and pull the mongo image from Dockerhub and run the container. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and the MovieZ App will be running. Enjoy!

## Manually starting the Development server

Run `ng serve` for the frontend and `nodemon server` for the backend. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
